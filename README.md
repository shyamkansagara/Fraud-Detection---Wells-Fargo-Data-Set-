# Fraud-Detection---Wells-Fargo-Data-Set-
It is a fraud detection project to predict frauds in the dataset. 


I have uploaded the trainset on which you will be able to see the models that I have created but there is no way you will be able to measure how good your model is on test data. (As the test data is unlabelled, only the bank measure the accuracy)

Steps to refer the whole project:
1) Download the Trainset 
2) Use the Wells Frago Preprocessing.ipynb 


The algorithms that I used for prediction:
1) Random Forest Classifier 
2) Decision Tree Classifier 
3) Ada Boost
4) Logistic Regression 
5) H20 AutoML model to get the best model. Low code model. Research more on this.



Best Results will be shown by AdaBoost and XGBoost
